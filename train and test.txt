x1_train, x1_test, y1_train, y1_test = train_test_split(x1, y1, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

The testing and training data are split from the original dataset df1 into four separate sets:

x1_train: This contains the features (input variables) for the training data.
x1_test: This contains the features for the testing data.
y1_train: This contains the corresponding labels (output variable) for the training data.
y1_test: This contains the corresponding labels for the testing data.
The train_test_split function from scikit-learn is used to randomly split the dataset into training and testing sets. Here's how the split works:

The test_size=0.2 parameter indicates that 20% of the data will be reserved for testing, while 80% will be used for training.
The random_state=42 parameter ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed to a specific value. This means that every time you run the code with the same random seed, you will get the same split.
